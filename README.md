# R++_old (deprecated)

*I'm not sure that variants are the way to go, rather templated containers in the new R++ repo*
An R *inspired* toolkit of heterogeneous data types and statistical functions written in C++.

Designed to offer *familiar enough* semantics with their R language counterparts to facilitate R knowledge and skills transfer into the C++ domain.

## R-ish types and functions so far:

| | | | | | |
|----------------	|---------------	|--------------	|---------------	|----------------	|-------------------	|
|[x] vector       |[x] variant      |[x] data_frame |[x] date         |[ ] matrix       |[ ]                  |
|[x] as_dates     |[x] factor       |[x] floor      |[x] match        |[ ]              |[ ]                  |
|[x] range        |[x] read_csv     |[x] rescale    |[ ]              |[ ]              |[ ]                  |
|[x] sort         |[x] split        |[ ]            |[ ]              |[ ]              |[ ]                  |
|[x] unique       |[ ]              |[ ]            |[ ]              |[ ]              |[ ]                  |


## example usage

main.cpp is your best place at the moment
